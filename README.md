## About me
Hi! 

I am Hannah, when I am not in the mountains, then I am an pre-doctoral researcher in economics at the University of Zurich. 



## Research

In my research I am interested in inequalities on labor markets and the income & wealth inequalities between individuals. 
I want to understand what are the drivers of changes in inequality, such as technologies, and how people perceive these inequalities. 



**Working papers:**

- _"The Effects of Minimum Wage Increases on Poverty and Food Hardship"_ (with Parolin, Lehner, Schmidt) â€” [Link to paper or abstract]
- (Mis)perceptions of Inequality and their determinants"_ (with Schmitt, LÃ¶ffler, Moya, Memmen, Franetovic)

## Teaching

- **2024â€“2025**: Tutorium for Statistics in R (WU)
- **2025**: Tutor for GAIN Network (UZH)
